                "this is an extraordinary car race that takes place annually in June at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans. The circuit takes its name from the nearby river, the Sarthe. Here's something interesting: unlike many other tracks, this race is run 'clockwise', meaning the cars take the turns to the right.  The aim of this race is to complete as many laps as possible in a 24-hour period. It is one of the oldest and largest car races in the world and is considered one of the most prestigious alongside other famous races such as the Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix and the Indy 500 (Indianapolis 500).",
